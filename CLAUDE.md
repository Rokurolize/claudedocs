- For commits related to a Github issue, add
  ```bash
  git commit --trailer "Github-Issue:#<number>"
  ```
- NEVER ever mention a `co-authored-by` or similar aspects. In particular, never
  mention the tool used to create the commit message or PR.
- Check git status before commits
- Run formatters before type checks
- Keep changes minimal
